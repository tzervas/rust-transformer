feat(transformer): Initial implementation of Rust Transformer with temporal continuity

This commit introduces the initial implementation of a Transformer architecture in Rust,
with extensions for temporal continuity. The implementation includes both core transformer
components and novel temporal mechanisms for maintaining state across sequences.

Core Components:
- Multi-head self-attention mechanism with scaled dot-product attention
- Position-wise feed-forward networks with configurable activation functions
- Positional encoding (both sinusoidal and learned variants)
- Layer normalization with residual connections
- Complete encoder-decoder architecture

Temporal Extensions:
- Temporal attention mechanism for cross-sequence state handling
- Persistent memory bank with configurable retention policies
- Temporal positional encoding with decay factors

Architecture:
- Memory-efficient tensor operations using nalgebra
- Module structure for clear code organization
- Comprehensive error handling and type safety
- Thread-safe memory management

Technical Details:
- Uses nalgebra for efficient matrix operations
- Implements custom error types with thiserror
- Generic implementations supporting f32/f64
- Configurable model architecture

Development Infrastructure:
- Containerized development and testing environment
- Resource monitoring and debugging tools
- Isolated testing environment
- Development-time security controls

Testing & Validation:
- Basic validation of core components
- Isolated testing capabilities
- Resource usage monitoring during development

Next Steps:
- Add comprehensive unit tests
- Implement benchmarking
- Add training pipeline
- Expand documentation
- Performance optimization

Breaking Changes: None (initial implementation)
